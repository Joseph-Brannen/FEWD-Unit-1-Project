        <h2>Baseball</h2>

        <p>My parents love the Atlanta Braves and baseball. Here's a picture of PNC Park. That's where the Pittsburgh Pirates play, and it was the first non-Braves game my parents went to together.</p>
        <p>Their goal is to visit every MLB stadium. One day they plan to do a 90-day roadtrip touring all the stadiums at once while visiting national parks along the way. My mom plans the roadtrip each year for fun.</p>

        <h2>Pickleball</h2>

        <p>My parents also really like playing pickleball.</p>
        <p>I would tell you more, but I get frustrated talking about it because they should be playing fetch with me instead.</p>
